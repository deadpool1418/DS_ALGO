Solution 1:
1. Sort the array in ascending order
2. Use three for loops to find 3 numbers
3. To find fourth number use binary search
4. Keep the quad in hashset to avoid the duplicates

Solution 2:
1. Sort the array in ascending order
2. use 2 for loops to find 2 numbers and get new target
3. use two pointers and two sum to get the third and fourth number
4. skip the duplicates to get unique quads
